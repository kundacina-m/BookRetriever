# BookRetriever
A internship app to demonstrate skills needed for developing a good, modular and scalable Android app using Kotlin, Android Architecture Components (LiveData, ViewModel & Room), Dagger and Retrofit 2 among others.

# Features
Some of the features of the app include:

- **Effective Networking** - Using a combination of Retrofit, Rx, Room and LiveData, we are able to handle networking in the most effective way.
- **MVVM architecture** - Using the lifecycle aware viewmodels, the view observes changes in the model / repository.
- **Kotlin** - This app is completely written in Kotlin.
- **Android Architecture Components** - Lifecycle awareness has been achieved using a combination of LiveData, ViewModels and Room.
- **Offline first architecture** - All the data is first tried to be loaded from the db and then updated from the server. This ensures that the app is usable even in an offline mode.
- **Dependency Injection** - Common elements like context, networking interface are injected using Dagger 2. (In progress)

# Libraries used


- **Android Support Libraries**
- **Retrofit**
- **OkHttp**
- **Picasso or Glide** (to be used for images)
- **Room**
- **ViewModel**
- **LiveData**
- **RxJava**
- **Dagger 2**  (to be used for Dependency Injection)

# Testing

Research phase.

# UI

Just basic elements, needs polishing.
